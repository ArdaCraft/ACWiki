ArdaCraft is a modded Minecraft server that is aiming to recreate the world of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth. The server was started in early May of 2014, by Dags and Fornad. The server has since gotten the addition of modded blocks, many new members and builders, media attention, and a continuously thriving community.
