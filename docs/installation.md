ArdaCraft offers two ways to install and use the modpack: via the [launcher](#launcher) and [self-install](#manual)

## Launcher

The ArdaCraft launcher offers an easy way to install all the mods needed to enjoy playing on our server.

The launcher automagically installs the correct Java JRE for you, so you won't need to mess around with installing the latest version.

Start off by downloading the launcher from our github page:
* If you're on Windows grab the `.exe` [here](https://github.com/ArdaCraft/ACLauncher/releases/download/v4.3.5/ArdaCraftLauncher-4.3.5.exe)
* If you're on Linux or Mac grab the `.jar` [here](https://github.com/ArdaCraft/ACLauncher/releases/download/v4.3.5/ArdaCraftLauncher-4.3.5.jar)

Install steps:
1. Run your downloaded launcher **You may get a message that says this is not a trusted program, run it anyway.**
    - Note that the ArdaCraft Launcher will default install to a folder called `ArdaCraft Launcher` in your `C:\Users\%yourusername\Documents` folder.
2. Once it is installed, select the Modpack which you prefer. The `ArdaCraft Modpack 1.12.2` pack is the preferred version as highlighted below. The Conquest Reforged versions do not include the ArdaCraft [Resourcepack](https://github.com/ArdaCraft/AC_Overlay/releases/latest), so if you plan on joining the ArdaCraft server be sure to pick one of the ArdaCraft Modpacks.

3. Log in with your Minecraft account. This process uses the Mojang authentication service and we do not see any of your information.
4. You will be given a screen showing optional mods that are in the pack. None of these mods are required to join the server and you may install mods as you wish.

5. The launcher may take serveral minutes to download all the needed files depending on your connection.
6. Once everything is installed Minecraft will start. **Your game may freeze on startup and you may have a (not responding) message, this is normal just let it load.**
7. Once you are on the main menu screen, go to `Options` then `Resource Packs...` and move the `AC_Overlay.zip` file above the `Conquest Reforged.zip`
    - This is what your Resource Packs page should look like:

8. You now have everything you need to join the server. The IP is `mc.ardacraft.me` and you can view other conquest servers with the arrow on the right hand side of the Multiplayer page.

## Manual 

If you prefer to use the default Minecraft Launcher, or have troubles with the ArdaCraft Launcher, you can do a self-install.

1. First install [Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.12.2.html) for Minecraft 1.12.2.
2. Run Minecraft with the Forge profile enabled.
3. Download Conquest Reforged [here](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/conquest-reforged/files)

5. Download Optifine for 1.12.2 [here](https://optifine.net/downloads).
6. Put the `OptiFine_1.12.2.jar` into your Minecraft's `mods` folder.
7. Download the ArdaCraft Resource Pack [here](https://github.com/ArdaCraft/AC_Overlay/releases/latest) as well as the Conquest Resource Pack [here](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/conquest-reforged-resource-pack/files) and put them in your `resourcepacks` folder.
8. Once you are on the main menu screen, go to `Options` then `Resource Packs...` and move the `AC_Overlay.zip` file above the `Conquest Reforged.zip`
    - This is what your Resource Packs page should look like:
